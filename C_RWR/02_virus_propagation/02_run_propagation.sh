# This script is a pipeline for running a mofified RWR algorithm, inspired by
# the one used in the paper 'Large-scale phage-based screening reveals extensive 
# pan-viral mimicry of host short linear motifs' by Mihaliƒç et al. Nature 
# communications 2023.The script runs 02_virus_propagation.py and does it in parallell 
# for efficeny.
